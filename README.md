# Vigenesque HTML - A Single Web Page for Simple Encryption and Decryption of Multifactor Authentication Backup Codes

Vigenesque HTML allows you to perform reasonably-secure encryption and decryption on multi-factor authentication backup codes (or similar random short strings of letters and/or numbers). It is a static HTML web page in a single file that you can store offline on your computer or mobile device or somewhere online. The web page performs all computation in your browser's Javascript engine and does not send or receive any information. The encryption is deliberately simple so that you can, if needed, perform encryption and decryption by hand using pen and paper. The encryption method is quite similar to the [Vigen√®re cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher).

## Use Case <a name="use-case"></a>

I created this because I wanted to bring my multi-factor authentication backup codes with me when travelling. There is always a risk that the "second factor" required to access your online accounts (your phone or other device) will be lost or stolen. If that happens, you cannot access your accounts unless you recover the device or use your backup codes. To reduce the risk of being locked out of online accounts, your backup codes must travel with you.

Your phone provider may offer a "find my phone" or "erase my phone" feature. But, for security reasons, accessing those features usually requires that you authenticate using your "second factor," which you won't have if it's the phone you're trying to find! Losing your phone with no backup codes can mean your phone is gone forever, possibly along with sensitive data stored on it. [Here is a cautionary tale](https://lifehacker.com/dont-use-sms-for-googles-two-step-verification-in-case-1823144781).

That cautionary tale recommends the conventional solution to losing your "second factor", which is to bring a paper copy of backup codes when travelling. You cna also store them somewhere online that won't require that "second factor" to access them. But backup codes are sensive information. They can function just like passwords. If they are lost or stolen, someone can use them to access your accounts.

Bringing those codes with you or storing them on the internet with weak authentication introduces the risk that an unauthorized person can get them. Paper is particularly bad because someone can copy or take a photo of your backup codes, leaving the papers seemingly untouched. You won't know that someone has access to your accounts. Not good.

With Vigen-ish HTML you can easily secure your backup codes and keep them with you on paper or in online storage without the risk that someone can use them to access your online accounts. If you don't have access to this HTML web page, the encryption method is simple enough that you can decrypt your backup codes using a pen and paper.

While this encryption method is not perfect, I prefer it to the risks above. It balances security with simplicity. Use this web page to encrypt one or more of your backup codes, print or write down the encrypted codes, and keep a paper copy of the encrypted codes with you. I recommend keeping the paper copy under your control at all times, as you would do with an identification card or any other sensitive document. That way you will know if anyone else gets access to it.

## How to Use It (Encrypting) <a name="how-to-use-it-encrypting"></a>

To encrypt a backup code, first load the web page in a web browser. In this repository, the web page is in the file `vigenesque.html`. The web page does not require any external resources. You don't need an internet connection if you have the file stored on a device and you have a web browser.

### Provide a Password

Choose a password and type it into the textbox labeled "Password." The password will encrypt your backup code. To decrypt the code you'll need that password. Don't forget it! It's best to use a random series of letters and numbers, but it's not necessary if you're encrypting a backup code and you use a long enough password (12 characters is pretty good). Choose as long a password as you can, while ensuring that you won't forget it. To keep the encryption simple, your password may only contain letters and numbers. Also, passwords are not case-sensitive (upper and lower-case letters are treated the same). You'll see an error alert in the web browser if you dont format the password correctly.

### Provide the Backup Code to Encrypt

Type the backup code that you want to encrypt in the box labeled "Backup Code." A backup code can only contain letters and numbers. You are allowed to enter spaces (just spaces, no tabs or other whitespace) as in the backup code to encrypt. Spaces pass through untouched during encryption and decryption. For example, encrypting the code "a b c" might generate the encrypted string "d e j." Using the same password, encrypting the code "abc" would generate the encrypted string "dej." Adding spaces to split up text can make it easier to read encrypted and decrypted text. If the backup code you're encrypting contains a different separator like a hyphen, you can replace those with spaces, if you'd like.

### Encrypt the Backup Code

Click the "Encrypt" button and the backup code will be encrypted using the password you provided. If you're missing any required fields or if you've included characters that aren't allowed, an alert in the browser will let you know what you need to fix. If the backup code you entered has spaces in it, the encrypted code will have spaces in the same places. Spaces are ignored when information is decrypted so you may remove spaces when you write down or before printing out the encrypted code, if you'd like.

### Store the Encrypted Code Somewhere

After you click the "Encrypt" button, the encrypted code will appear in the text box labeled "Encrypted Code." You can copy and paste that encrypted code into a document to save it somewhere safe or print it out on paper. If you don't have a printer, you can simply write the encrypted code on a piece of paper. I have one word of caution about saving the encrypted codes in online/cloud storage. If you don't have access to your second factor authentication device, then you need the backup codes. But if you need the backup codes to access the online storage where the document with the backup codes is stored, you're stuck! If you do store the backup codes document online, make sure that it's secured only with a password that you know and won't require your second factor authentication device. This is a use case where "low tech" paper storage can be a pretty safe backup, in case technology fails you.

## How to Use It (Decrypting) <a name="how-to-use-it-decrypting"></a>

To decrypt a backup code, first load the web page in a web browser. In this repository, the web page is in the file `vigenesque.html`. The web page does not require any external resources. You don't need an internet connection if you have the file stored on a device and you have a web browser.

### Provide the Password

Type the same password that you used to encrypt the backup code into the textbox labeled "Password." To keep the encryption simple, your password may only contain letters and numbers. Also, passwords are not case-sensitive (upper and lower-case letters are treated the same). You'll see an error alert in the web browser if you dont format the password correctly.

### Provide the Encrypted Backup Code

Find the encrypted backup code on your paper or online copy of the encrypted codes. Type the encrypted backup code labeled "Encrypted Code." You are allowed to enter spaces (just spaces, no tabs or other whitespace) in the encrypted backup code, even if you did not enter spaces in the backup code when you encrypted it. Spaces are ignored when information is decrypted so you can also remove spaces from the encrypted backup code before decrypting, if you want to.

### Decrypt the Backup Code

Click the "Decrypt" button and the backup code will be decrypted using the password you provided. If you're missing any required fields or if you've included characters that aren't allowed, an alert in the browser will let you know what you need to fix. Any spaces you enter in the encrypted backup code will appear in the same place in the backup code when it's decrypted. When you click the "Decrypt" button, the decrypted backup code will appear in the "Backup Code" text box. This makes it easy to select, copy, and paste the backup code as needed.

## Things You Should Not Do <a name="things-you-should-not-do"></a>

### Don't Encrypt Codes that Aren't Random

You should not encrypt dictionary words with this cipher because this encryption is breakable if you know something about the language that the original text was written in. The same is true for credit card numbers, phone numbers, social security numbers, and any other information that is not random. Backup codes are usually random (or, at least, impossible to predict) sets of letters and/or numbers. If your backup code contains dictionary words, don't use this tool to encrypt it.

Unless the data you are encrypting is effectively random, this encryption is not safe to use. If you'd like to learn more about why, here is [a nice explanation of how to break this encryption when the encrypted text contains dictionary words](https://crypto.interactive-maths.com/kasiski-analysis-breaking-the-code.html). This cipher works well for backup keys because it is not possible to learn anything about the encryption key by analyzing the encrypted text.

### Don't Use Very Short, Obvious, or Previously-Used Passwords

You've heard this advice before. Passwords in this tool are no different. This web page will let you use whatever password length you'd like when encrypting you backup codes. But longer passwords are better than shorter ones. If you're encrypting data that appears random, such as backup keys, a completely random password is less important. But it's still preferred. It's also important to know that this encryption algorithm repeats password multiple times when it's shorter than the backup code you're encrypting. This repeated use of the password could make it easier for a sophisticated cryptanalyst to figure out your password by analyzing patterns in the encrypted text. If your backup codes are truly random this risk is extremely low. But a shorter password will be repeated more times so, in theory, there are more opportunities to look for patterns if your password is short. Most importantly, if your password is very short or obvious (like "a" or your name), it's simply very easy for someone to guess. Finaly, don't encrypt your backup codes using a password that you already use with other services because passwords are sometimes stolen from other services. People trying to decrypt your backup codes might try previously-stolen passwords to see if they are reused.

### Don't Store your Encrypted Backup Codes in Insecure Locations

Even though they are encrypted, don't treat encrypted backup codes like they're public information. With sufficient analysis, someone might be able to figure out your encryption password. That analysis would require a lot of time. So it's important that you know if your encrypted codes have been accessed or stolen. Keep paper copies of the encrypted codes with you. It's not a bad idea to store the encrypted codes somewhere online (in "the cloud") so you can access them if you lose both your second factor device and your encrypted paper backup codes. Of course, make sure that you don't need your backup codes to access that online storage! But online storage is not secure if you don't require a password to access the encrypted backup codes. If you save the backup codes in a PDF document, you can secure that file with a password very easily. Also, most online storage services like Google Drive, DropBox, OneDrive, etc. will let you share a file or folder and secure it with a password.

### Don't Use This to Encrypt Backup Codes for Services that Allow Many Backup Code Attempts

Usually a service will only let you try to enter a correct backup code a few times before it locks or suspends the account. If your backup codes are for a large well-known email or online/cloud storage service, there's probably nothing to worry about. But if you're not sure, you should do some research to make sure that the service only allows a few attempts to enter a correct backup code before locking or suspending the account. If someone obtains your encrypted codes and attempts to decrypt them, they must try out the backup code to see if their attempt was successful. Even with sophisticated analysis of your encrypted codes, if you're using a good password to encrypt your backup codes, someone would need to try many backup codes to successfully access your account. If the online service only permits a few attempts before locking the account, it will be virtually impossible for someone to use your encrypted codes to access your account.

### Don't Label Encrypted Backup Codes with The Service Name or Your Login Name/E-mail Address
